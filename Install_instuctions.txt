leaving this file in case of any confusion.

I am assuming you have already installed php and mysql servers.

Install instructions:
• create database named "villa_project"
• open file "sql_commands.txt" in notepad and copy all commands
• open phpmyadmin, then go sql console and paste these commands. it will create required tables.
• place the project files in root directory, or in a seperate folder
• run the project (localhost)
